How old is the universe?
The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, according to measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and observations of distant galaxies. This age has been determined through multiple independent methods that all converge on this figure.

What is the Big Bang?
The Big Bang is the prevailing theory describing the origin of the universe from an extremely hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. It was not an explosion in space, but rather the expansion of space itself from an incredibly small point.

Is the universe infinite?
We don't know for certain if the universe is infinite or finite. The observable universe has a radius of about 46.5 billion light-years, but the total universe could extend far beyond what we can observe, and may even be infinite in size.

What is dark matter?
Dark matter is an invisible form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content. We know it exists because of its gravitational effects on visible matter, galaxies, and cosmic structure, but its exact nature remains one of physics' greatest mysteries.

What is dark energy?
Dark energy is a mysterious force comprising about 68% of the universe that appears to be causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. Its nature is unknown, but it may be a property of space itself or a new type of energy field.

How big is the observable universe?
The observable universe extends approximately 46.5 billion light-years in every direction from Earth, giving it a diameter of about 93 billion light-years. This is larger than 13.8 billion light-years because space has been expanding while light travels toward us.

What is a black hole?
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. They form from collapsed massive stars or accumulation of matter in galactic centers, and can range from stellar to supermassive in size.

How many galaxies are in the universe?
Current estimates suggest there are approximately 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Each galaxy contains millions to trillions of stars, along with gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.

What will happen to the universe in the future?
Based on current observations, the universe will likely continue expanding forever, eventually experiencing a "heat death" where all stars burn out and the cosmos becomes cold and dark. This process will take trillions upon trillions of years to unfold completely.

What is the cosmic microwave background?
The cosmic microwave background is the faint afterglow of the Big Bang, consisting of ancient light released about 380,000 years after the universe's birth. It permeates all of space and provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and insights into the early universe's conditions.

Can we travel to other galaxies?
With current technology, intergalactic travel is impossible due to the vast distances involvedâ€”millions to billions of light-years. The nearest large galaxy, Andromeda, is 2.5 million light-years away, far beyond our technological capabilities for the foreseeable future.

What came before the Big Bang?
We don't know what, if anything, came before the Big Bang, as time itself may have begun with the Big Bang. The question may not even be meaningful in a conventional sense, as our understanding of physics breaks down at the moment of the universe's origin.

Are there other universes?
The multiverse hypothesis suggests our universe might be one of many, but this remains speculative with no direct observational evidence. Some theories in physics, such as eternal inflation and string theory, predict the existence of other universes, but they remain unproven.

What is a supernova?
A supernova is a massive stellar explosion that occurs when a star reaches the end of its life, either by exhausting its nuclear fuel or accumulating too much mass. These explosions briefly outshine entire galaxies and scatter heavy elements throughout space, enriching the interstellar medium.

How do stars form?
Stars form when clouds of gas and dust in space collapse under their own gravity, heating up until nuclear fusion ignites in their cores. This process occurs in stellar nurseries called molecular clouds or nebulae, where thousands of stars can form simultaneously.

What is a light-year?
A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers or 5.88 trillion miles. It's a unit of distance, not time, used by astronomers to measure the vast scales between stars and galaxies.

Is there life elsewhere in the universe?
We don't yet know if life exists elsewhere, but given the universe's vastness and the billions of potentially habitable planets, many scientists consider it statistically likely. However, no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life has been discovered despite ongoing searches.

What is antimatter?
Antimatter consists of particles with the same mass as ordinary matter but opposite charge and other quantum properties. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other in a burst of energy, and the universe's apparent lack of antimatter compared to matter remains a mystery.

How fast is the universe expanding?
The universe is expanding at a rate of about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec, meaning that for every 3.26 million light-years of distance, space is expanding at 70 km/s. This expansion rate, called the Hubble constant, means distant galaxies are receding from us faster than nearby ones.

What are gravitational waves?
Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by accelerating massive objects, such as colliding black holes or neutron stars. Predicted by Einstein's general relativity and first directly detected in 2015, they travel at the speed of light and provide a new way to observe cosmic events.
